# Week8 mini rust project -- Word Count
This mini project is a command line tool that count words in a file

To run the program, compile it with rustc command: `rustc word_count.rs`

This will create an executable file named word_count. You can then run the program and provide a filename:
 
```
$ ./word_count file.txt
Total word count: 209
```
